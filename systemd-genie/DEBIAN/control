Description: A quick way into a systemd "bottle" for WSL.
 What does that even mean?
 Well, this gives you a way to run systemd as pid 1, with all the trimmings, inside WSL 2. It does this by creating a pid namespace, the eponymous poor-man's-container "bottle", starting up systemd in there, and entering it, and providing some helpful shortcuts to do so.
 Please see instructions on the homepage for more details.
